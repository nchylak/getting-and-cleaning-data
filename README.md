# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This project was created as part of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course in the Data Science specialisation by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

## Getting Started

Get started by forking this repository and cloning it locally on your machine.

The repository is made of the following files: 

* A markdown file **README.md**
* An R script **run_analysis.R**
* A markdown file **CodeBook.md** describing the data and the manipulations performed by the script for cleaning and analysing it.

For being able to use the attached script, you need to:

* Download the supporting dataset [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) (see "Data Folder").
* Install the **dplyr** library.

## Built With
